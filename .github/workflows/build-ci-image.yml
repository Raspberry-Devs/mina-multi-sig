# This workflow builds a Docker image with pre-installed dependencies for FROST examples.
#
# This workflow runs:
# - Weekly (to get latest security updates)
# - You manually trigger it on GH actions (with latest label from main and pr specific label if made from branch)
# - You push changes to the image to main
